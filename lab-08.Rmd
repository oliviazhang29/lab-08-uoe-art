## Load Packages and Data  

First, let's load the necessary packages:  

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(skimr)
```

Now, load the dataset. If your data isn't ready yet, you can leave `eval = FALSE` for now and update it when needed.  


```{r load-data, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Remove eval = FALSE or set it to TRUE once data is ready to be loaded
uoe_art <- read_csv("data/uoe-art.csv")
```

## Exercise 9

Let's start working with the **title** column by separating the title and the date:  

```{r separate-title-date, error = TRUE}
uoe_art <- uoe_art %>%
  separate(title, into = c("title", "date"), sep = "\\(") %>%
  mutate(year = str_remove(date, "\\)") %>% as.numeric()) %>%
  select(title, artist, year, ___)  # Fill in the missing variable!
```

Make sure to replace `___` with the appropriate column name.  


## Exercise 10
